"""``KeyringTokenStore`` — OAuth TokenSet ↔ OS keychain (M15.3).

One slot, one JSON blob. The store holds the entire ``TokenSet``
under a single ``(service, username)`` pair so saving and reading
are atomic operations against the keyring backend; splitting access
and refresh across separate slots would open a TOCTOU window where
a crash between the two writes leaves the keychain inconsistent.

All three public methods are defensive:

- ``save`` writes the full TokenSet, overwriting any prior value.
- ``load`` returns ``None`` when the slot is empty, when the JSON
  is corrupt, or when the JSON parses but fails ``TokenSet``
  validation. Each of these maps to "operator must re-login" —
  surfacing them as exceptions would force every caller to handle
  three flavours of "no usable token", which is the same path.
- ``delete`` is idempotent: deleting a non-existent slot is a no-op,
  not an error. ``yadirect-agent auth logout`` always exits zero on
  the no-op path.

The method is named ``delete`` rather than ``revoke``: it removes
the local keychain slot only. Yandex OAuth has no public revocation
endpoint, so a true server-side revoke is impossible from the CLI;
the refresh token Yandex issued remains valid until manual
revocation at https://yandex.ru/profile/access. The method name
reflects what we actually do — delete a local secret — instead of
implying a server-side action we cannot take.

The keychain backend is auto-detected by the ``keyring`` package:
Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, Secret Service
(KWallet / GNOME Keyring) on Linux. Headless / Docker / CI fall
back to env vars in ``Settings`` (M15.3 layer 7).
