"""@requires_plan decorator + apply_plan executor (M2.2 part 3a).

This module is the glue between the pipeline (``SafetyPipeline``),
the plan store (``PendingPlansStore``), and concrete service methods
that want to mutate Direct. It is deliberately agnostic of any specific
service class — the decorator resolves the pipeline and store via a
``_resolve_safety() -> (pipeline, store)`` method that the decorated
class must implement. PR B wires ``CampaignService`` against this
contract.

Flow (``@requires_plan`` path):

    agent → service.set_daily_budget(1, 200)
         → decorator builds OperationPlan + ReviewContext
         → pipeline.review(plan, ctx) → SafetyDecision
         → allow:   wrapped method runs; pipeline.on_applied(ctx)
            confirm: plan appended to store; PlanRequired raised
            reject:  PlanRejected raised; nothing persisted

Flow (``apply_plan`` path — operator confirming a pending plan):

    operator → yadirect-agent apply-plan <id>
             → apply_plan(id)
             → store.get(id); validate status == pending
             → deserialize_review_context(plan.review_context)
             → pipeline.review(plan, ctx)  [re-review against original ctx]
             → reject:  store.update_status(id, rejected); raise
                allow/confirm: service_router(action, args, _applying_plan_id=id)
                              → decorator bypass (sees _applying_plan_id)
                              → wrapped method runs
             → success: store pending→applied; pipeline.on_applied(ctx)
                        (best-effort — see below)
             → exception: store pending→failed; DO NOT call on_applied
                          (propagate error to operator)

Ordering of ``store.update_status("applied")`` BEFORE
``pipeline.on_applied(ctx)`` on the success path is deliberate
(auditor C-1). The API call has spent real money; the plan record
must reflect that immediately so a crash here cannot leave the plan
in ``pending`` and let a second ``apply-plan`` double-spend.
``on_applied`` is best-effort post-success — if it raises, the
session TOCTOU register loses one entry (defendable degradation:
the next plan goes through normal pipeline checks) but the store
correctly reflects the API write.

The ``on_applied`` contract on the failure path is a hard invariant
— if the executor raises, the session TOCTOU register must not
record the approved bid. Tested in ``TestApplyPlanExecutorFailure``
and ``TestApplyPlanOnAppliedRobustness``.

    Invariants (tested in ``test_executor.py``):

    1. ``plan.status`` must be ``pending`` on entry. Any other status
       is ``InvalidPlanStateError`` — applied / rejected / failed are
       terminal; ``approved`` is legacy / unused for now.
    2. ``plan.review_context`` must be non-null. Apply-plan re-reviews
       the plan against the original snapshot before executing, so a
       plan without a stored context cannot be applied.
    3. Re-review runs exactly once before the executor. A ``reject``
       here updates the store to ``rejected`` (catches snapshot drift)
       and propagates ``PlanRejected`` without touching the executor.
    4. If the executor raises, ``pipeline.on_applied`` is NOT called
       and the store is updated to ``failed``. This is a hard
       invariant: the session TOCTOU register must never reflect an
       API call that didn't succeed.
