"""Tests for the MCP server wrapper (M3.1 + M3.2).

Scope: ``build_mcp_server`` correctly wraps the existing
``ToolRegistry``, gates write tools behind ``allow_write``, and
preserves the safety / audit envelope built by
``build_default_registry``. Stdio transport / Claude Desktop
integration are operator-runnable end-to-end concerns and not
